# The Structuralist Platform: Issues (v2.0)

**Philosophy:** The Tri-Kernel Analysis (Roh / LKY / Franklin)
**Objective:** System Stability, Throughput, and Equity.

---

## 1. Gun Control
**The Glitch:** The current system oscillates between unenforceable bans (a firewall that leaks) and unregulated chaos (buffer overflow). The debate is paralyzed by "rights" absolutism versus "safety" hysteria.

**Structuralist Analysis:**
*   **Roh (The Conscience):** Current gun violence disproportionately harms the vulnerable while the wealthy insulate themselves. This is a failure of state protection.
*   **LKY (The Architect):** Disorder is unacceptable. A society where citizens must arm themselves against each other is a failed state. The monopoly on violence belongs to the state, or there is no state.
*   **Franklin (The Hacker):** "A well-regulated militia." The key word is *regulated*. Liberty requires responsibility. If you own a dangerous tool, you insure it against the damage it causes.

**The Patch: Liability & Licensing**
1.  **Mandatory Liability Insurance:** Treat firearms like vehicles. Every gun owner must carry liability insurance for their weapon. The free market—not the government—will price the risk of high-capacity magazines versus hunting rifles.
2.  **Universal Registry (Blockchain):** Every firearm is a registered node. Transfer without update is a felony.
3.  **The "Well-Regulated" Standard:** Ownership requires passing a rigorous, LKY-style safety and competency exam. If you fail, you are de-listed.

## 2. Climate Change
**The Glitch:** Relying on moral shaming to stop physics. We are debating "degrowth" while the server room overheats. The current strategy is all frontend (activism) and no backend (engineering).

**Structuralist Analysis:**
*   **Roh (The Conscience):** The poor will suffer first from climate collapse. It is a crime against the future to delay action for the sake of quarterly profits.
*   **LKY (The Architect):** Survival is non-negotiable. If the water rises, Singapore drowns. We do not have the luxury of debating the "perfect" solution. We need the one that works *now*.
*   **Franklin (The Hacker):** "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." But when prevention fails, invention must succeed. We must hack the planet if necessary.

**The Patch: The Energy Hard Fork**
1.  **Nuclear Baseload:** Re-open every nuclear plant. Fast-track SMR (Small Modular Reactor) deployment. It is the only zero-carbon source that scales for AI energy needs.
2.  **Carbon Pricing Algorithm:** Hard-code the externality. If you emit, you pay a progressive tax. The market will optimize the reduction better than any bureaucrat.
3.  **Geo-Engineering R&D:** Franklin would be testing cloud seeding and carbon capture *yesterday*. We must prepare the emergency brake.

## 3. Immigration
**The Glitch:** A firewall that blocks high-value packets (talent) while leaking indiscriminately at the edges.

**Structuralist Analysis:**
*   **Roh (The Conscience):** Migrants are human beings, often fleeing systems we helped break. We cannot brutalize them. Fair process is mandatory.
*   **LKY (The Architect):** A nation is a talent magnet. If we turn away the world's best because of xenophobia, we deserve to decline. But we cannot have a welfare state with open borders; the math does not work.
*   **Franklin (The Hacker):** "Where liberty dwells, there is my country." The cosmopolite seeks the best minds to build the republic.

**The Patch: The Talent Protocol**
1.  **Points-Based Kernel:** Adopt the Singapore/Canada model. If you add value to the GDP (coding, engineering, medicine), you get a visa instantly.
2.  **Digital Nomad Visas:** Frictionless entry for remote workers who spend foreign income locally.
3.  **Strict Enforcement:** A firewall must work. Illegal entry is patched with immediate deportation, but the *legal* path is widened 10x for talent.

## 4. The Economy & Automation
**The Glitch:** Human labor is being deprecated by AI. The old "work for survival" loop is breaking. Minimum wage fights are fighting the last war.

**Structuralist Analysis:**
*   **Roh (The Conscience):** It is foul play to let the owners of capital capture 100% of the automation dividend while workers starve.
*   **LKY (The Architect):** Do not subsidize inefficiency. If a job can be done by a script, let the script do it. Retrain the human for higher-order tasks.
*   **Franklin (The Hacker):** "Industry need not wish." But when industry is automated, the citizen must become an investor in the commonwealth.

**The Patch: The Citizen Stack**
1.  **Automation Tax:** Tax the *compute* (GPU cycles) used to replace labor, not the labor itself.
2.  **Universal Basic Compute (UBC):** Distribute a "Citizen's Dividend" from the automation tax.
3.  **Abolish the Minimum Wage:** *If* the Dividend covers basic survival (food/shelter), remove the price floor on labor to allow maximum employment flexibility.

## 5. Abortion & Biological Rights
**The Glitch:** The state trying to legislate the biological kernel.

**Structuralist Analysis:**
*   **Roh (The Conscience):** The state has no right to force a citizen to endure a medical condition against their will. Bodily autonomy is the first tier of rights.
*   **LKY (The Architect):** Pragmatically, unwanted children often lead to poor social outcomes. A rational state ensures every child is *wanted* and can be supported.
*   **Franklin (The Hacker):** Privacy is the bedrock of a free society. What happens in the biological instance is private to the user.

**The Patch: Biological Sovereignty**
1.  **Codify Roe:** Hard-code the right to privacy in medical decisions. The state has no root access to the individual biological instance.
2.  **Massive Contraception Subsidy:** Reduce the *need* for the procedure through system support (free, universal access to birth control).
3.  **Natal Support:** If a citizen chooses to reproduce, the state invests heavily in that future node (childcare, healthcare).

## 6. Voting & Governance
**The Glitch:** Analog trust in a digital age.

**Structuralist Analysis:**
*   **Roh (The Conscience):** Every vote must count. Suppression is a bug. Gerrymandering is a hack.
*   **LKY (The Architect):** The system must be robust against attack. We cannot allow doubt to fester. Verification is not oppression; it is security.
*   **Franklin (The Hacker):** "A Republic, if you can keep it." Today, keeping it requires cryptography.

**The Patch: Cryptographic Verification**
1.  **National ID (Keypair):** Every citizen receives a cryptographic keypair (National ID). It is free and automatic.
2.  **Open Source Voting:** All voting machines must run open-source code, auditable by any citizen. Paper trails are mandatory for recovery.
3.  **Election Holiday:** Voting Day is a national holiday. Zero friction.

**Summary:** We do not care about Left or Right. We care about Up (Efficiency) and Open (Transparency).
**Status:** `PENDING COMMIT`
